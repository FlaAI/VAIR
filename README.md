- Thank you for your access! This is a temporary repository specifically built for the review process.

- Our main script is provided as *adv_ft_vair_whisper.py*, and the detailed experimental setup can be found within *adv_ft_vair_whisper_tiny_en.yaml*. We would make the whole source code public after the manuscript is accepted.
  
- The code implementation is based on [speechbrain](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain) and [robust_speech](https://github.com/RaphaelOlivier/robust_speech). Our great thanks for the generous open-source!
